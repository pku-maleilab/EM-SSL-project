Napari-OmniEM is a Napari plugin that provides a unified, GPU-accelerated interface for electron microscopy (EM) image processing. Built on top of EM-DINO and OmniEM , it enables scalable, high-quality inference across heterogeneous 2D and 3D EM datasets, bridging foundation models with practical, interactive EM workflows. Napari-OmniEM supports both in-memory and on-disk (multi-GPU) inference, and task-aware model management , making it suitable for exploratory analysis, large-volume processing, and downstream quantitative studies.

Step 1: Download Napari-OmniEM Download the napari-omniem.zip archive from the given google driver folder xz and extract it to a local directory: unzip napari-omniem.zip cd napari-omniem Step 2: Create a Conda Environment We recommend using conda to manage dependencies. conda create -n napari-omniem python=3.11 -y conda activate napari-omniem Step 3: Install PyTorch with CUDA Support Install PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA version for your system. # Example: CUDA 11.8 pip install torch torchvision torchaudio \\ --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 Visit PyTorch to find the correct installation command for your GPU and CUDA version. If you do not have a GPU, install the CPU-only version instead. Step 4: Install Napari Install napari and its GUI dependencies pip install napari[all] Step 5: Install Napari-OmniEM Install the plugin in editable (development) mode: pip install -e . This makes the plugin immediately available in napari. Step 6: Launch Napari Start napari from the command line: napari Once napari is running, you should be able to find OmniEM in the plugin menu. Notes Ensure that your GPU drivers and CUDA runtime are properly installed before installing PyTorch with CUDA support. For large-volume inference, sufficient GPU memory and disk space are required. Multi-GPU inference is supported when multiple CUDA devices are available.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"user-guide/installation/#installation","text":"This guide walks you through installing Napari-OmniEM from a downloaded archive and preparing the runtime environment.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"user-guide/installation/#step-1-download-napari-omniem","text":"Download the napari-omniem.zip archive from the given google driver folder xz and extract it to a local directory: unzip napari-omniem.zip cd napari-omniem","title":"Step 1: Download Napari-OmniEM"},{"location":"user-guide/installation/#step-2-create-a-conda-environment","text":"We recommend using conda to manage dependencies. conda create -n napari-omniem python=3.11 -y conda activate napari-omniem","title":"Step 2: Create a Conda Environment"},{"location":"user-guide/installation/#step-3-install-pytorch-with-cuda-support","text":"Install PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA version for your system. # Example: CUDA 11.8 pip install torch torchvision torchaudio \\ --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 Visit PyTorch to find the correct installation command for your GPU and CUDA version.
